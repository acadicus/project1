<p>Ah, my God, all my past ruin has arisen from a want of conformity to thy will. O God of my soul, I<br> detest and curse a thousand times the days and moments in which I have, in order to do my own<br> will, contradicted thy holy will. I now give my whole will to thee. Accept it, O my Lord, and bind it so<br> firmly to thy love, that it may nevermore be able to rebel against thee. I love thee, O infinite<br> Goodness, and through the love which I bear thee, I offer myself entirely to thee. Dispose of me and<br> of all I possess as thou pleasest; I resign myself entirely to thy holy will. Preserve me from the<br> misfortune of doing anything against thy holy will, and then treat me as thou wishest. Eternal<br> Father, hear me for the love of Jesus Christ. My Jesus, hear me through the merits of thy passion.<br> Most holy Mary, assist me; obtain for me the grace to fulfill the divine will, in the accomplishment of<br> which my salvation entirely consists; obtain this grace for me, and I ask nothing more.

  <p>3/31/2022<br>Insert Sam Hyde talking about boomer's viewing the modern world through the rose tinted glasses of their own.<br>I think the most profound fracture in my father's worldview was when with substantial job experience I was unable to get a higher-paying job and had to settle for a job usually worked by high school students. It's not the 80s anymore. I could not have possibly taken my father's path; mailboy at 11, baker at 16, machinist at 20. That path is impossible now. I had to wait until I was 16 to get a job in a machine shop, and even then it went through rigorous approval by the busybodies in my town's government. Gone are the mailroom to CEO days. But our parents still live in that time within their heads. It's unfathomable to them as well that the progeny they've invested so much into are not beloved by the system as well.<br><br>Systems created by a geriatric class to hoard their wealth to preserve themselves by only several weeks as they starve their descendants of wealth that should be bestowed upon them. Even my own father is guilty of this contradiction in his worldview. His demand for me to pay him rent serves only the goal of hoarding his own wealth. It doesn't teach me a lesson about the real world, it doesn't allow me to get ahead in my financial situation. This is a handicap that he places on me all while astounded that I'm being locked out of the skilled workforce by his same generation.<br><br>Forgive your parents. It's the only way to break the cycles the boomers have set in motion. They will never be put in nursing homes. No matter how much they handicap me, my children will see only the love I have for them, and I will seek to only benefit them rather than handicap through my own delusions.</p>
  
  <p>3/30/2022<br>I've now only come to realize that my excessive consumption of caffeine is a form of self-medication. I've only realized this after listening to Sam Hyde speak about how young men will try to escape through various pleasures to avoid the hurt that is associated with life. This serves only to hurt your development as a man, and something that should have been painfully obvious to me. The reality is that I am still depressed about losing love a year after its passing. I am depressed, I am broken, and I am still so weak. This is unacceptable. If I saw a friend or my own son acting in this way, I would work to free them from this illusion. I would beat them; relentlessly; without restriction. Physically, I am stimulating seratonin receptors artifically with caffeine. The high I get, the pride I feel when I drink almost a gram a day, is what's keeping me blind from the reality that I am being self-destructive.</p>
  
  <p>3/24/2022<br>I believe that I do stand at the precipice of a new era in my life. I have suffered so much over the last year, and the only regret from this time is that I did not offer more of this suffering for Our Lord Jesus Christ. I have postured myself to reap the rewards of this suffering, and the hard work done during this time. A new golden age will be upon me, I will make certain of it.</p>
  
<p>3/23/2022<br>Those specifically who insist we should embody the revolutionary spirit of America's founders should not encourage the adoption of all of the opposite characteristics of our enemies. The characteristics of ourselves and our enemies do not alwways exist on a dipole; sometimes they've taken and perverted the best of our virtues. When we discuss our enemies, we are truly speaking of Satan and the work of his minions among us. The devil twists and contorts the virtues we possess. Therefore, the submission to the authority of an evil government that practices infanticide is a perverted submission to a greater good, i.e. God. Anti-authority does not exist on the good end of the spectrum and submission to authority the on evil, as our revolutionary spirited friends seem to think. Rather, anti-authority to good government and submission to bad government rest on the evil end of the spectrum, while submission to good government and anti-authority to bad government rests on the good. Our friends may even be tempted by Satan into developing a protestant-like distaste for submission to anything: to God, to government, to ego. </p>
