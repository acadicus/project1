<p>Ah, my God, all my past ruin has arisen from a want of conformity to thy will. O God of my soul, I<br> detest and curse a thousand times the days and moments in which I have, in order to do my own<br> will, contradicted thy holy will. I now give my whole will to thee. Accept it, O my Lord, and bind it so<br> firmly to thy love, that it may nevermore be able to rebel against thee. I love thee, O infinite<br> Goodness, and through the love which I bear thee, I offer myself entirely to thee. Dispose of me and<br> of all I possess as thou pleasest; I resign myself entirely to thy holy will. Preserve me from the<br> misfortune of doing anything against thy holy will, and then treat me as thou wishest. Eternal<br> Father, hear me for the love of Jesus Christ. My Jesus, hear me through the merits of thy passion.<br> Most holy Mary, assist me; obtain for me the grace to fulfill the divine will, in the accomplishment of<br> which my salvation entirely consists; obtain this grace for me, and I ask nothing more.

<p>3/23/2022<br>Those specifically who insist we should embody the revolutionary spirit of America's founders should not encourage the adoption of all of the opposite characteristics of our enemies. The characteristics of ourselves and our enemies do not alwways exist on a dipole; sometimes they've taken and perverted the best of our virtues. When we discuss our enemies, we are truly speaking of Satan and the work of his minions among us. The devil twists and contorts the virtues we possess. Therefore, the submission to the authority of an evil government that practices infanticide is a perverted submission to a greater good, i.e. God. Anti-authority does not exist on the good end of the spectrum and submission to authority the on evil, as our revolutionary spirited friends seem to think. Rather, anti-authority to good government and submission to bad government rest on the evil end of the spectrum, while submission to good government and anti-authority to bad government rests on the good. Our friends may even be tempted by Satan into developing a protestant-like distaste for submission to anything: to God, to government, to ego. </p>
