  <h3><b>Selected readings from <i>Divine Intimacy</i></h3></b>
  
  <p><b>226<br><br>1.</b> The mystery of the Most Blessed Trinity is the root and center of all the other mysteries of our holy faith: the root from which they all spring and upon which they depend, the center about which they gravitate.<br><br><b>2.</b> By the mere fact that all God's works are a proof of His omnipotence, His wisdom, and His goodness, they all redound to His glory, just as a work of art always gives honor to the artist who made it, because it is an expression of his genius.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have we not understood that it is truly right and just that our whole life and all our works should be a hymn of glory to the Blessed Three who, althought infinitely happy and glorious in Themselves, wish to be glorified in Their poor little creatures!</p>
