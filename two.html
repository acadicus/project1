<p>11/10/2019<br>We have iphones at the cost of beauty and spontaneity. Our souls have been sapped so we can labor for corporate entities and the liberal hegemon, and generously given the opportunity to purchase a glimpse of what we could wholly grasp via ‘campgrounds’ and ‘museums.'<br><br>It is the nature of life that beauty is fleeting. Man is a sex of permformance, of utility. Woman is a sex of aesthetic, her utility being that of the proliferation of our offspring.<br><br>How do we react -cope- with our fleeting utility? Can you prepare? Can you safeguard?

There is beauty in spontaneity, beauty IS spontaneous; it is not calculated, meticulous, predictable; it is in total opposition to the dredges of monotony.<br><br>Entropy; everything that is created will be destroyed. There is beauty in women, in art, and in the stars. Eventually, women will die, art will be destroyed and forgotten, stars will explode. Is there beauty in death? In entropy?

And even if there is overlap, does this negate their distinct natures? Surely there can be overlap while still maintaining two distinct definitions.<br><br>Is there beauty in death?<br><br>Anti-capitalist attitudes of transcendentalists. Capitalism has reduced us to cogs, to slaving away doing manual labor. Our tasks are tedious. Were not our tasks in agriculture, in the cities producing, even on the frontier surviving, tedious? Is it the nature of our civilizations to be reduced to a simple cog in the machine, condemned to tedium and barred from spontaneity?<br><br>How much progress is too much?<br><br>We have a lack of spontaneity in our current situation; yet another symptom of modernity. Have you ever been thrilled at the unexpected arrival of an altered schedule at work or at school? Most of us are re<br>What would the reintroduction of spontaneity mean for our society? Is our success due to our meticulousness? Could a billion-dollar merger come underway if we did not have to adhere to scheduling?<br><br>No, there must be a less radical solution. Introduce spontaneity into your soul by… As Bronze Age Pervert (BAP) instructs, reinvent beauty. As I have mentioned, beauty in our day to day lives are dwindling. There is beauty in family,<br><br>(Spontaneity is beautiful, beauty is something to strive for, therefore, spontaneity is something worth introducing into your life).
